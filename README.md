# PowerPilot

A Home Assistant custom integration that optimizes the use of a home battery /
inverter (e.g. Victron) under a **dynamic energy tariff**, factoring in household
consumption, EV charging, weather, heating/cooling and the calendar.

The goal: **minimize the cost of energy** by orchestrating charge / discharge /
passthrough, EV charging, and grid connection — while always knowing the
**price of the energy currently stored in the battery, after losses**.

## What it produces

For every hour of the horizon (as far as price data reaches), PowerPilot decides:

| Output | Values | Entity |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Inverter mode | charge / discharge / passthrough | `sensor.powerpilot_inverter_mode` |
| Charge power | full / limited (limited while EV uses the shared phase) | `sensor.powerpilot_charge_power` |
| Grid connected | on / off (off below the SoC floor) | `binary_sensor.powerpilot_grid_connected` |
| EV charge | on / off | `binary_sensor.powerpilot_ev_charge` |
| Battery energy cost | PLN/kWh after losses | `sensor.powerpilot_battery_energy_cost` |
| Full plan (chart data) | per-hour forecast + decisions | `sensor.powerpilot_optimization_plan` |

The `optimization_plan` sensor exposes the whole horizon as attributes
(`hours` + `forecast`), driving the two-chart dashboard in
[dashboards/powerpilot-dashboard.yaml](dashboards/powerpilot-dashboard.yaml)
(SoC/flows + prices incl. the battery-cost line). It needs the `apexcharts-card`
frontend card (HACS → Frontend).

## Architecture

A small stable core surrounded by independent **modules** that each contribute one
slice of information to a shared hourly forecast, which the **optimizer** turns
into decisions. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and the staged
delivery plan in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

```
modules (prices · consumption · loads · weather · climate · ev · calendar)
        → ForecastBuilder → Optimizer (+ BatteryModel) → Plan → entities
```

## Installation

1. Copy `custom_components/powerpilot` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/`
   directory (or add this repository to HACS as a custom repository).
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration →
   PowerPilot** and complete the two-step setup (core + EV).

## Status

Stage 0 (foundation) is implemented: scaffold, core models, the battery
cost-after-losses model, the module pipeline, a transparent heuristic optimizer,
config/options flow, and all output entities. Subsequent stages (real price API,
consumption learning, EV+calendar, weather/climate, LP optimizer, dashboard) are
tracked in the roadmap.
